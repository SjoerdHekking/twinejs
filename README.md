### SYNOPSIS

This is a port of Twine to a browser and Electron app. See
[twinery.org](https://twinery.org) for more info.

The story formats in minified format under `story-formats/` exist in separate
repositories:

-   [Harlowe](https://foss.heptapod.net/games/harlowe/)
-   [Paperthin](https://github.com/klembot/paperthin)
-   [Snowman](https://github.com/klembot/snowman)
-   [SugarCube](https://github.com/tmedwards/sugarcube-2)

### INSTALL

Run `npm install` at the top level of the directory to install all goodies.

Working with the documentation requires installing
[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), which is not a Node-based
project. You can either install it directly from the project web site or use
your operating system's package manager.

### BUILDING

Run `npm start` to begin serving a development version of Twine locally. This
server will automatically update with changes you make.

Run `npm run start:electron` to run a development version of the Electron app.
**Running this can damage files in your Twine storied folder. Take a backup copy
of this folder before proceeding.** Most of the app will automatically update as
you work, but if you want the app to read story files initially again, you will
need to restart the process.

To create a release, run `npm run build`. Finished files will be found under
`dist/`. In order to build Windows apps on macOS or Linux, you will need to have
[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and [makensis](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)
installed. A file named `2.json` is created under `dist/` which contains
information relevant to the autoupdater process, and is currently posted to
https://twinery.org/latestversion/2.json.

The build process looks for these environment variables when notarizing a macOS
build:

- `APPLE_APP_ID`: The app ID to use. The convention is `country.company.appname`.
- `APPLE_ID`: User name of the Apple account to use for notarization.
- `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`: App-specific password for the Apple account to use for
  notarization.

If any of these environment variables are not set, the build process will skip
notarizing. This means users will need to right-click the application and open
it manually.

You must have the full Xcode app installed to notarize the app, not just the
Xcode command line tools.

`npm test` will test the source code respectively.

`npm run clean` will delete existing files in `electron-build/` and `dist/`.
